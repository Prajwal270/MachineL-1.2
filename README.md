# MachineL-1.2
Machine Learing Algorithm testing



## Different Machine Learning Algorithms :

**Regression** : Simple Linear Regression, Non linear Regression, Polynomail Regression

**Classification** : Logistic Regresssion, SupportVectorMachine(SVM), KNearestNeighbours

**Clustering** : k-mean clustring, k-nearest-neighbour. 


## Language and Libraries 
- Python 3 and above
- pandas => For Exploratory Data Analysis 
- numpy => to work with dimensions (arrays)
- matplotlib => to visualize the data, and look for pattern
- seaborn => to get over all analysis of data using graphs
- scikit-learn => to get different kinds of ML algorithms
- sqlite3 => to ingest data in to the jupyter notebook


## Machine Learning algorithms used 

- Linear Regression
- k-means clustering
- DecisionTreeClassifier
- Logistic Regression
- SVM Classification


## Software Required (Basic setup)
- IPython environment and Jupyter notebooks
- Python 3
- Conda for package management and virtual environments

If it is not able to install and run these software on the local system
then, online [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notbook can be used to do the same.
